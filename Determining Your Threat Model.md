#### What are Threat Models?
In general, the more secure/private something is, the more restrictive or inconvenient it is; so we want to balance security/privacy with convenience. And if our countermeasures are not even enough and sometimes overkill, we need to make a better strategy and use suitable tools. That's why threat modeling is important.

By focusing on your threat model, you understand the amount of protection you need, so you can choose the right tools for the job.

A threat model is a list of the most likely threats to your security and privacy efforts. Objective of threat modeling :  Identify security requirements and probable security threats and potential vulnerabilities.

#### Examples Of Threat Models
- An average person's threat model might be to hide their data from surveillance and tech corporations.
- A developer's threat model might be to protect themselves against hackers.
- A journalist's threat model might be to protect themselves against a government, an agency or a corporation.


#### Creating your threat model
Before deciding what countermeasure to use, first you need to know if the threat is serious, or even practical. This can be done by asking a series of questions to yourself in order.

1. What needs protection?
2. What are the potential threats and vulnerabilities?
3. How bad are the consequences if I fail?
4. How much trouble am I willing to put countermeasures?


We will take a example and answer all of these questions and make a plan for our needs. This is just a example so I recommend to first read this through and then ask these questions to yourself.

**Example** : I'm a normal citizen and I need to protect myself from surveillance and large tech corporations.

##### What needs Protection?
Private data on my interests, location, services I use, et cetera.

##### What are the Potential Threats and Vulnerabilities?
This means who I need to protect (what needs protection) from.

Threats: In this example we need protection from Data Brokers, Tech Companies (ex: Google, Facebook, Apple, et cetera) and Government.

Vulnerabilities: Cross Site Cookies, IP logging, Device/browser Fingerprinting, Malware/Spyware, GPS, Wi-fi and Bluetooth, et cetera.

##### How Bad Are The Consequences If I Fail?
Government, agencies and tech giants will have every piece of information about me and my dog. Actually just anyone can have that information in exchange of money from **data brokers**. Maybe someone is targeting me and they can buy information about me (which should be ultra private) from data brokers.

##### How much trouble am I willing to put countermeasures?
I'm okay with using VPN, adding browser extensions, doing some tweaks, using email alias and moderate amount of convenience.  

Now answer to this question determines how much security/privacy and convenience you will have. More convenience means less security/privacy and vice versa.

Everyone does not have the same priorities and threats. Evaluating your risk will help you to plan the right strategy that balances convenience and privacy and maybe some cost too.

##### Your Threat Level
Based on the threats, vulnerabilities and convenience, I've marked some levels which will make it easier for you to navigate on our blog on **operational security** where you can find tools and well made strategy for your threat model.

Threat Level 2 :
